### Lesson 1 value investing

- Value Trading
- Asset: continue put money to your pockage
- patent
- liability: Take money away
- warren buffett's advisor: Benjamin Graham
    + security analysis
    + the intelligent investor

### Lesson 2 ice cream business

- Net income (earnings)
    + divident
    + equity
- board of directors (reprentor of shareholder)
- Find companies that trade for less than 15 times the earnings

- balance sheet (margin safety): what would happen if the business liquidated right now !
- cash flow statement
- market price for the ice cream stand: $200,000
- Equity = Total assets - total liability
- The closer the equity is to the market price, the safer the investment

### Lesson 4 finding basic stock terms

- value ice-cream stand: $100,000
- shares outstanding: 10,000
- so 1 share = $10
- EPS (earnings per share) = Net income / share outstanding

- book value (equity per share) = equity / share outstanding

1. P/E = Market Price / EPS
> For every # dollars I spent buying this stock, I should receive 1
> dollar in profit a year later

- always calculate the intrinsic value of the business, then compare the value to the price it trades for.
