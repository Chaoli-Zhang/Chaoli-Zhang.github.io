- Find companies that trade for less than 15 times the earnings

### L 3 balance sheet and margin of safety

![](/img/Stock/BL2.png?raw=true)

![](/img/Stock/BL3.png?raw=true)

- income statement (company profit)
- balance sheet (margin safety): what would happen if the business liquidated right now !

### L 4 finding basic stock terms

![](/img/Stock/BL4.png?raw=true)


- value ice-cream stand: $100,000
- shares outstanding: 10,000
- so 1 share = $10
- EPS (earnings per share) = Net income / share outstanding

- book value (equity per share) = equity / share outstanding

1. P/E = Market Price / EPS
> For every # dollars I spent buying this stock, I should receive 1
> dollar in profit a year later

- stock investing is locrative: so many people don't analyze data
- always calculate the intrinsic value of the business, then compare the value to the price it trades for.

### L 25 income investing

Income investing is the concept of purchasing bonds and stocks that will provide income for the owner in retirement through stable coupon and dividends. The amount should be so high that when you are living the life style you want to, your portfolio would remain the same or even increase.

A practical example can be used to explain this concept. Imagine that you have $1,000,000 in retirement and you are able to make a stable 5% return. In that case you would receive $50,000 each year in proceeds from your investment. That means that if you expenses are equal or below this amount you can maintain the lifestyle for the rest of your life.

Which approach should you take if you are near retirement age and you want to invest in companies that benefit you right now and well into your retirement? The answer is quite simple: “Invest in stable companies that pay dividends”.

To illustrate this, it is shown is this lesson how high debt companies through the recent financial crisis dramatically cut their dividend payments. This is surely not a situation you want to be exposed to if you are supposed to pay your bills with your dividend payments. Companies that have a much lower debt on the other hand managed to sustain or even increased their dividend.

One simple rule to remember when speaking about income investing: “Always purchase assets that will increase your cash flow next month”. It could be low debt stocks paying dividends, or a bond paying coupons. Income investing has a compounding effect that is hard to find elsewhere.

Typically the attractiveness of your investment opportunities constantly changes. The benefit of a continuously increase in monthly cash flow is that you can keep investing in the assets that is currently undervalued.

Finally in the lesson a conclusion is presented:

Income investing provides a quarterly payments during retirement
Income investing provides a stable stream of cash that allow you to buy the currently most undervalued assets. This is especially beneficial prior to retirement.
As a rule of thumb 1/3 of earnings as dividend and 2/3 as retained earnings is desired.

### L 26 - 27 cash flow statement

The cash flow statement can be broken down into three components:

1)  Operating Activities (Look for a high positive number)

This is the most important number to look for. This is the cash that is produced by the company’s operations, and without that, the cash flow from investing and financing activities cannot be healthy. While the net income is a key number and is also included in the calculation of operating activities, many other factors influence how much cash the company is actually making. If you see a high positive cash flow from you operating cash it is typically a positive of a healthy business.

2)  Investing Activities (Look for a negative number

All companies need cash to reinvest in the business. It might be for new machines, cars or property. Often companies also invest in common stock or bonds, and all of that is too finance by the investing activities. If you see that the cash flow from investing activities is positive, this would imply that the company has sold income producing assets. While that may nice in the short run to obtain more cash, this would most often be followed by a decline in in later earnings. Therefore you want investing activities to show a negative cash flow.

3)  Financing Activities (Look for a negative number)

Financing activities includes handling of debt and relationship to the investors, and is a neat number to investigate for management’s financial discipline. If you see that this number is positive it would typically imply that the company has obtained more debt, or in some cases that it has issued more shares. While tis extra cash can be very useful in some cases, it can also be a sign of trouble. An increase in debt means higher interest payment in the long run, and common stock issue dilute the investor’s ownership of the company. A negative number on the other hand indicate that debt has been repaid, common stock has been bought back (increasing investors’ ownership of the company), or dividend has been paid out to the shareholders.

### L 28 WHEN TO SELL STOCK

1) When a higher return is expected by trading with another asset (considering the capital gains tax)

One thing that might be tempting to do is keep trading your stocks when you find a new company that you really like. The problem about this approach is that you have to pay capital gains tax every time you sell a stock with profit. We learned more about capital gains tax in lesson 19 and saw that it was a large expense that required unrealistic stock picking skills. Continuously paying tax on your profit instead of deferring your tax obligation implies that the amount of money that you invest for decreases.

Therefore, when you sell stocks, you should evaluate if the expenses you incur in terms of tax outweigh the higher expected return on the new stock pick.

To fully understand when you should sell stocks, it is recommended to fully understand the calculation of intrinsic value that was taught in lesson 21.

Assume your current holding is called XXX and the new stock you are looking at is called TTT. By following a few simple steps you can determine whether you should sell your stocks or not.

1.1) Calculate the expected annual return for stocks XXX and TTT based on the current market prices and intrinsic values
1.2) Subtract the cost of capital gains tax from stock XXX
1.3) Calculate whether stocks XXX or TTT yield the highest expected annual return based on a given time frame.

2) When the company changes the fundamentals

Another important factor Warren Buffett really looks for when selling his stocks in a company is whether the fundamentals of the business are changing. What that means in practice is whether the first three rules are being broken. As we have learned in lesson 18-20, that would happen in situations where: the company is no longer managed by vigilant leaders, the company no longer has long-term prospects, and where the company is neither stable nor understandable.

One final thing to take away from this lesson is that the process of determining if stocks should be sold or not is actually not as complicated as it may look at the face of it. With a little practice, it becomes fairly easy.

### L 29 WHAT IS RETURN ON EQUITY

The Return on equity (ROE) offers the investor a very quick glance at whether a particular stock that he may be interested to invest in is worth it.

A prerequisite for understanding Warren Buffett’s assessment of ROE is to know how he values stocks and bonds. According to Warren Buffett, bonds and stocks can be valued similarly. The value of a bond is simply the payment of coupon and the par value in the end. While the bond can be bought at a discount or a premium (below and above par value) it cannot trade at a premium at the end of the term.

The owners of stocks do not receive fixed coupons, but receive variable dividends instead. Warren Buffett compares the par value of a bond with the book value of a stock, with the clear caveat that a stock can trade at a premium and that there is no maturity date.

To understand the implication of this, imagine a company that has a book value (or equity per share) of $10 and retain $5 in EPS one year. That would mean that the book value of that same stock increased to $15 – a 50% gain on book value. In investment terms, this is called a 50% ROE. According to Warren Buffett, this will be reflected in a 50% increase in market price:

The percentage change in book value in any given year is likely to be reasonably close to that year's change in intrinsic value – Warren Buffett

If you compare that to a $100 book value company ($100 in equity per share), which makes $5 per share, you can only expect this company to increase its equity and therefore increase the market price by 5%. In other words the ROE is 5%.

### L 30 WHAT IS VOLUME

we understand the importance of stock volume. Although the volume won’t help intelligent investors learn the intrinsic value of a company, it can be used as a tool to help predict market behavior.

Investors are often fooled into believing that the market price of a stock is determined by all the shareholders. This idea is false. When we look at the volume of a company on any given day, we can quickly get a sense of how many traders are actually determining the price of a stock when we compare this number to the shares outstanding. This ratio – volume/shares outstanding – provides a good idea about the number of traders moving into and away from the company. When the company trades at a very low volume, we can generally say that the shareholders agree with the market price. Likewise, if the volume is very high, we can generally say that the shareholders disagree with the market price.

In the video, we demonstrate this principal with Wells Fargo (WFC). When you look at the historical market price for WFC, you will learn that on the day the volume was the highest in ten years, the market price was at an all time low. This idea of shareholders disagreeing with the market price when the volume is relatively high is an important point that stock traders can use to their advantage. Always remember, volume can mean that the stock is overpriced or underpriced. The peak or valley is for you to discern.

The takeaway from this lesson can be summed up to the following:

- Remind yourself that traders only determine the price of the stock, not the value
- Stock volume can be an indicator for when to buy stocks or adjust your portfolio in general

### L 31 STOCK TERMINOLOGY

- Shares Outstanding:
Shares outstanding refer to the number of shares that are held by all the stockholders of the company. If there are 100 outstanding shares and you own 1 share, you own 1% of that company. Shares outstanding are reported numbers that require no calculation.

- Earnings per Share (EPS):
Knowing how much money a company makes it very neat, but as a shareholder it is often more important to know what the earnings are on a per share basis. The reason is that as a shareholder, you are being rewarded according to your level of ownership. The key ratio is calculated as Net income / Shares outstanding.

- Diluted EPS:
Diluted EPS is very similar to EPS. The difference occurs when companies reward employees with stocks. More stocks mean that the ownership, including the earnings becomes diluted. Therefore, Diluted EPS is therefore a more accurate measure to use than normal EPS. It is calculated as: Net income / Diluted average shares.

- Price to Earnings (P/E):
The Price to Earnings or P/E is a very commonly used key ratio to indicate the price level of a stock. For instance, a P/E of 18 means that $18 is the cost of $1 earnings a year later. It is calculated as: Stock price / EPS

- Stock Volume:
Stock volume is the number of shares of a given stock that are being traded on a daily basis. This number is reported, and therefore, it doesn’t come with a formula.

- Dividend Rate:
The dividend rate is dependent on how much the management has decided to pay out as dividend. For example, if a company decides to pay out $1 in dividend per share, the dividend rate is $1.

- Dividend Yield:
The dividend yield indicates the size of the return an investor can expect to gain at the current price. If the stock price is $100 and each stock pays off $3, the yield is 3%. Often, this is simply reported as 3 with no percentage sign, but in any case, that is how it should be interpreted. It is calculated as: dividend rate / stock price.

- Debt/Equity Ratio:
The Debt/Equity ratio compares the amount of debt the company has incurred when compared to the equity of the company. The equation is very simple to remember: Debt / Equity.

- Book Value:
The book value number is sometimes known as the equity per share. What that number tells you as an investor, is if all the company’s assets were being liquidated and all debt was paid off, this is the cash you would be left with. The formula: Equity / Shares outstanding.

- Price/Book Value (P/BV):
Stocks are typically not priced at book value. Investors can be willing to pay a much higher price for an asset – like a patent – than what you can read from the books. Typically, the reason for this is that the investor deems high earnings potential or because it is considered a safe company. What the investor can take away from this number is a snapshot of the margin of safety. For instance, if a stock that’s trading at a high P/B is considerably above 1.5, there is often very little margin of safety. Warren Buffet would want to omit this too and in other words, the stocks may be overpriced. Formula for P/BV: Stock price / Book value.

- Equity Growth:
The equity growth measures the book value growth per share over a given time period. The BuffettsBooks.com intrinsic calculator can help you calculate that number using book value inputs over your desired period of investigation.

- Return on Equity:
Any investor would want the Return on Equity ratio to be as high as possible, stable and increasing. Since the equity is the shareholders money, the ROE is a measure of how well the shareholder’s money is reinvested in the business. The formula for ROE is: Net income / Equity

- Current Ratio:
The current ratio indicates the amount of cash the company can expect to convert over the next 12 months. It also includes the amount of cash the company is expected to pay out over the same time period. Current ratio is calculated as: Current assets / Current liabilities.

### L 32 A STOCK SCREENER

In this lesson, we learn how to use a stock screener. There is a variety of stock screeners on the market, but a great advantage with Google’s stock screener is that it is completely free. All stock screeners have one common purpose. Given the quantitative input criteria the investor puts in, the output will be the companies that meet those criteria.

Stock screener provides a large number of different key ratios that all can be found useful depending on the investor and his investment strategy. In this lesson, BuffettsBooks.com is setting the criteria based on the following key ratios:

- Market Cap
- P/E Ratio
- Dividend yield
- P/B ratio
- Total Debt/Equity
- Current ratio
- Return on equity 5 year average
- Return on equity most recent quarter

It is really important to emphasize that there is no right or wrong criterion to use. For instance, Warren Buffett likes a P/E ratio below 15, but if you have a strategy where you would accept a P/E that is 20, it is completely fine. Also, in this lesson, we learn that the selected criteria depend on the general state of the economy. For example, in a very high stock market you need to loosen up on your criteria to find investment prospects, while a stock market crash would allow you to be very picky in your criteria for stock selection.

In the end, a stock screener is nothing more than a tool that gives you an indication of potential bargains. To figure out if it is a stock worth investing in, a comprehensive qualitative study must always be conducted as well.
