The materials that I found particularly useful when I firstly dip into the field. I posted them up here for two reasons: 1> I can quickly re-access them whenever/wherever I want,  2> some of those might be helpful to you as well.

Of course, if you have anything better, please do not hesitate to share it by commenting at the bottom of the page.

Happy learning and studying!
